**Welcome to my portfolio!**
---------------------------------

My name is **Men Vuthy**. I am a Civil Engineer, specialized in river and geospatial engineering,  with industry experiences in piped-water supply design, hydrological modeling, GIS, mapping, geo-data/satellite image analysis, programming, classification and big data. I am currently an Engineer in River Department at Nippon Koei Co., Ltd based in head quarter in Tokyo, Japan, where I work on different kinds of data sorting tasks, satellite-image analysis and Deep Learning models to do semantic segmentation on satellite images. Besides that, I sometimes offer an online course on `Geospatial Data Analysis with Python <https://geospatialyst.github.io/homepage/course/>`__ to Cambodian graduated students and professionals.

I graduated a master of Civil Engineering degree from The University of Tokyo in Japan in 2020. I recieved solid training in flood simulation and damage assessment, programming languages, machine learning and deep learning. I am proficient in QGIS/ArcGIS/ArcGIS Pro, geospatial data analysis, LaTeX, Python and Geo-Python, data retrieval and processing in Google Earth Engine, data classification and extraction, and data visualization. I am particularly interested in working with satellite image data and dealing with large dataset. On the other hand, I like to spend time learning something new and explore more knowledge from various sources, and then write it down to my personal portfolio. More details about some of my projects and documentations can be found in this website.
