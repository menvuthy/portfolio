Forest cover plays an essential role in delivering important ecosystem services, including biodiversity richness, climate regulation, carbon storage, and water supplies (1). However, spatially and temporally detailed information on global-scale forest cover changes at a high resolution did not exist until M.C. Hansen and his team in the University of Maryland, USA developed a global-scale forest change and published the works in 2013 (2). Hansen et al. 2013 (2) mapped global tree cover extent, loss, and gain annually for the period from 2000 to 2012 from Landsat imagery at a spatial resolution of 30 m, especially the datasets have been updated every year. 


The data source of information content presented here is publicly availble for both `download <https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.7.html>`__ and `web-based visualizations <http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest>`__. However, downloading and processing such a large dataset are extremely tedious, and extracting it for analysis on a cloud platform can be the main challenges for some engineers and scientists who are struggling with remote sensing technology. Therefore, here I will illustrate one of many remote sensing methods to extract the datasets to:


1. Visualize the global forest cover in 2000, and forest cover loss during the period 2000-2019. 
2. Examine the spatial and temporal changes of both forest cover loss and gain in Cambodia from 2000 to 2019.
3. Compute the yearly forest cover and loss in Cambodia from 2000 to 2019.


.. note::
    These dataset illustration and visualization are aimed for *Education Purpose* only.

Global Forest Cover and Loss
---------------------------------------------

In this dataset, there are four important definitions as following:

- **Trees** are defined as vegetation taller than 5m in height and are expressed as a percentage per output grid cell.
- **Forest Cover Loss** is defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state, during the period 2000–2019. 
- **Forest Cover Gain** is defined as the inverse of loss, or a non-forest to forest change entirely within the period 2000–2012. 
- **Forest Loss Year** is a disaggregation of total forest loss to annual time scales.

By only viewing the video, the forest cover loss of some areas are exaggerated due to the far view of image and also the low density of forest canopy at those areas; hence, it is important to zoom into some specific areas to have a closer view of the forest cover and loss. Figure 3 are the images of some well-known areas in Cambodia which provide a clearer and closer look on forest cover and loss.

Yearly Forest Cover and Loss in Cambodia
---------------------------------------------

Forest loss was defined as a stand-replacement disturbance or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale (2). The estimation yearly forest cover and loss are shown in figures below (Figure 5):

.. warning::
    All computed values here are unofficial calculation based on the instruction from `Google Earth Engine <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_forest_03a>`__. The user should be concerned of the accuracy with the actual data in their region of interest and the comparison with the official data source.

Method
---------------------------------------------

Extraction, computation and visualization of Hansen et al. 2013 (2) global forest cover data in this work are performed on cloud platform with the help of QGIS, Python, and Google Earth Engine. Therefore, it is important to equip with some background on programming language and QGIS application. Below, I will instruct how to extract, visualize, and compute the global forest cover data, and Cambodia will be chosen as a case study.

**1. Extraction and Visualization of Global Forest Cover and Loss**

There are many methods to extract and visulaize the remote sensing dataset, for example, by using Earth Engine JavaScript API. Under this purpose, it is, however, conducted in QGIS since the performace and loading speed of interactive maps are better. In order to connect QGIS with the earth engine datasets, installation of `Google Earth Engine Plugin <https://youtu.be/RNbzhlMHekU>`__ is first necessary. After that, open the Python Console in QGIS, and the global forest cover data will appear by running the script I provide here with the short description written with the hashtag (#) sign.

.. code-block:: python

    # Import module
    import ee
    from ee_plugin import Map

    # Add Earth Engine dataset
    image = ee.Image('UMD/hansen/global_forest_change_2019_v1_7')
    forest = image.select(['treecover2000'])
    loss = image.select(['loss'])
    lossYear = image.select(['lossyear'])

    # visualization setting
    vis = {
    'min': 0, 
    'max': 100, 
    'palette': ['#000000', '#005500', '#00AB00', '#00FF00']
    }

    # Add layer by masking the unecessary pixels from the map
    Map.addLayer(forest.updateMask(forest), vis , 'Global Forest in 2000')
    Map.addLayer(loss.updateMask(loss), {'palette': ['#FF0000']} , 'Loss 2000-2019')

**2. Examination of Forest Cover Loss and Gain in Cambodia**

In order to target to any area, the boundary feature must be given so that the dataset will be clipped and shown for that feature only. In this example, Cambodia boundary was extracted from `Large Scale International Boundary <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USDOS_LSIB_SIMPLE_2017>`__ (LSIB) dataset provided by the United States Office of the Geographer. After setting the boundary of Cambodia, the forest cover loss and gain can be shown by running the script below. Besides QGIS, it can also be done in Google Earth Engine based on the instruction on 
`Quantifying Forest Change <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_forest_03>`__; however, it may be a bit challenging when it comes to downloading the data from cloud to local storage for analyzing or mapping.

.. code-block:: python

    import ee
    from ee_plugin import Map

    countries = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017')
    # // Get a feature collection with just the Cambodia feature.
    roi = countries.filter(ee.Filter.eq('country_co', 'CB'))

    # Add Landsat 8 Imagery for the year 2000 and 2019
    L8_2000 = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LT05/C01/T1_SR') \
        .filterDate('2000-01-01', '2000-12-31')\
        .filterBounds(roi)
    L8_2019 = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_SR') \
        .filterDate('2019-01-01', '2019-12-31')\
        .filterBounds(roi)

    # Define CloudMask Function
    def cloudMaskL457(image):
    qa = image.select('pixel_qa')
    # If the cloud bit (5) is set and the cloud confidence (7) is high
    # or the cloud shadow bit is set (3), then it's a bad pixel.
    cloud = qa.bitwiseAnd(1 << 5) \
            .And(qa.bitwiseAnd(1 << 7)) \
            .Or(qa.bitwiseAnd(1 << 3))
    # Remove edge pixels that don't occur in all bands
    mask2 = image.mask().reduce(ee.Reducer.min())
    return image.updateMask(cloud.Not()).updateMask(mask2)

    CB_2000 = L8_2000 \
        .map(cloudMaskL457) \
        .median()\
        .clip(roi)
    CB_2019 = L8_2019 \
        .map(cloudMaskL457) \
        .median()\
        .clip(roi)

    # visualization setting
    vis_1 = {
        'bands': ['B5', 'B4', 'B3'],
        'min': 0,
        'max': 4000,
        'gamma': [1, 1, 1]
    }
    vis_2 = {
        'bands': ['B6', 'B5', 'B4'],
        'min': 0,
        'max': 4000,
        'gamma': [1, 1, 1]
    }

    Map.addLayer(CB_2000, vis_1, 'CB_2000')
    Map.addLayer(CB_2019, vis_2, 'CB_2019')

    # Add Earth Engine dataset
    image = ee.Image('UMD/hansen/global_forest_change_2019_v1_7').clip(roi)
    treeCover = image.select(['treecover2000'])          
    lossImage = image.select(['loss'])
    gainImage = image.select(['gain'])

    # visualization setting
    vis = {
    'min': 0, 
    'max': 100, 
    'palette': ['#000000', '#005500', '#00AB00', '#00FF00']
    }

    # Add the tree cover layer in green.
    Map.addLayer(treeCover.updateMask(treeCover), vis , 'Forest in 2000')

    # Add the loss layer in red.
    Map.addLayer(lossImage.updateMask(lossImage),{'palette': ['FF0000']}, 'Loss')

    # Add the gain layer in blue.
    Map.addLayer(gainImage.updateMask(gainImage),{'palette': ['0000FF']}, 'Gain')


As for creating yearly forest cover map, the following script was written based on the data instruction on `Image Calculation <https://sites.google.com/site/earthengineapidocs/tutorials/global-forest-change-tutorial/basic-image-calculations?authuser=1>`__. Here is the script for creating the images of each year:

.. code-block:: python

    import ee
    from ee_plugin import Map

    countries = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017')
    roi = countries.filter(ee.Filter.eq('country_co', 'CB'))

    image = ee.Image('UMD/hansen/global_forest_change_2019_v1_7').clip(roi)
    forest = image.select(['treecover2000'])
    loss = image.select(['loss'])
    lossYear = image.select(['lossyear'])

    #2001
    lossInFirst1 = lossYear.gte(1).And(lossYear.lte(1))
    forestAt2001 = forest.where(lossInFirst1.eq(1), 0)
    #2002
    lossInFirst2 = lossYear.gte(1).And(lossYear.lte(2))
    forestAt2002 = forest.where(lossInFirst2.eq(1), 0)
    .
    .
    .

    #2019
    lossInFirst19= lossYear.gte(1).And(lossYear.lte(19))
    forestAt2019 = forest.where(lossInFirst19.eq(1), 0)

    vis = {
    'min': 0, 
    'max': 100, 
    'palette': ['#000000', '#005500', '#00AB00', '#00FF00']
    }

    Map.addLayer(forestAt2001.updateMask(forestAt2001), vis, 'Forest in 2001')
    .
    .
    .
    Map.addLayer(forestAt2019.updateMask(forestAt2019), vis, 'Forest in 2019')

**3. Computation of Yearly Forest Loss in Cambodia**

The computation for yearly forest cover and loss are conducted both in `Earth Engine Code Editor <https://code.earthengine.google.com>`__ and Python in Jupiter Notebook. Based on the instruction on how to quantify the yearly forest loss in the `GEE guideline <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_forest_03a>`__, the yearly forest loss in Cambodia can be estimated by changing the region of interest of the provided script. Regarding the detail estimation method, please carefully read the guideline of dataset usage.

Here is the script to run in GEE Code Editor for calculating yearly forest loss in Cambodia:

.. code-block:: JavaScript

    // Load country boundaries from LSIB.
    var countries = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017');
    // Get a feature collection with just the Congo feature.
    var cambo = countries.filter(ee.Filter.eq('country_co', 'CB'));
    Map.addLayer(cambo, {}, 'Cambodia')

    // Get the loss image.
    // This dataset is updated yearly, so we get the latest version.
    var gfc2017 = ee.Image('UMD/hansen/global_forest_change_2019_v1_7');
    var lossImage = gfc2017.select(['loss']);
    var lossAreaImage = lossImage.multiply(ee.Image.pixelArea());

    var lossYear = gfc2017.select(['lossyear']);
    var lossByYear = lossAreaImage.addBands(lossYear).reduceRegion({
                    reducer: ee.Reducer.sum().group({groupField: 1}),
                    geometry: cambo,
                    scale: 30,
                    maxPixels: 1e9
                    });
    
    print(lossByYear);

    var statsFormatted = ee.List(lossByYear.get('groups'))
                        .map(function(el) {
                        var d = ee.Dictionary(el);
                        return [ee.Number(d.get('group')).format("20%02d"), d.get('sum')]});
    
    var statsDictionary = ee.Dictionary(statsFormatted.flatten());
    
    print(statsDictionary);

    var chart = ui.Chart.array.values({
                    array: statsDictionary.values(),
                    axis: 0,
                    xLabels: statsDictionary.keys()
                    }).setChartType('ColumnChart')
                    .setOptions({
                        title: 'Yearly Forest Loss',
                        hAxis: {title: 'Year', format: '####'},
                        vAxis: {title: 'Area (square meters)'},
                        legend: { position: "none" },
                        lineWidth: 1,
                        pointSize: 3
                    });
    print(chart);

In order to calculate yearly forest cover, ``zonal_statistics_by_group`` function in ``geemap module`` was used in Python Jupyter Notebook to sum all forest cover pixels based on the size and forest canopy density of each pixel. Before calculation, installation of  ``geemap package`` may be necessary at the beginning if it is not yet installed on PC. The installation instruction is available `here <https://github.com/giswqs/geemap>`__.


To run the script below, the script in section 2 about creating yearly forest cover map should be firstly run in Jupyter Notebook by just omitting ``from ee_plugin import Map`` and import some other modules as following:

.. code-block:: python

    # Installs geemap package
    import subprocess

    try:
        import geemap
    except ImportError:
        print('geemap package not installed. Installing ...')
        subprocess.check_call(["python", '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'geemap'])

    # Checks whether this notebook is running on Google Colab
    try:
        import google.colab
        import geemap.eefolium as geemap
    except:
        import geemap

    # Authenticates and initializes Earth Engine
    import ee

    try:
        ee.Initialize()
    except Exception as e:
        ee.Authenticate()
        ee.Initialize()  
    import os

    [*** Script from Section 2...]

    # determine the output folder
    out_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Downloads')

    # statistics_type can be either 'SUM' or 'PERCENTAGE'
    # denominator can be used to convert square meters to other areal units, such as square kilimeters or hectare
    forest_cover = os.path.join(out_dir, 'forest-cover-2001.csv')  
    geemap.zonal_statistics_by_group(forestAt2001.updateMask(forestAt2001), roi, forest_cover, statistics_type='SUM', denominator=10000, decimal_places=2)

    forest_cover = os.path.join(out_dir, 'forest-cover-2002.csv')  
    geemap.zonal_statistics_by_group(forestAt2002.updateMask(forestAt2002), roi, forest_cover, statistics_type='SUM', denominator=10000, decimal_places=2)
    .
    .
    .
    forest_cover = os.path.join(out_dir, 'forest-cover-2019.csv')  
    geemap.zonal_statistics_by_group(forestAt2019.updateMask(forestAt2019), roi, forest_cover, statistics_type='SUM', denominator=10000, decimal_places=2)
