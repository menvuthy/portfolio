**Overview**

In this project, I try to develop supervised machine learning model in Python to classify the land cover type within the river channel. The model is developed by using the training data from 4 seasons of PLANET satellite images with 3-m spatial resolution at Kano and Yoshii river in Japan. 

The land cover is classified into 7 clases:

1. Herbecous
2. Shrub
3. High tree
4. Bamboo
5. Other vegetation
6. Built-up
7. Water surface

The input data for model development is the combination of Kano river and Yoshii river, and totally consists of 1,845,237 data or pixels. Then this data is split into 75% for training and 25% for testing as follows:

- Training data: 1,383,093 pixels
- Testing data: 462,144 pixels
